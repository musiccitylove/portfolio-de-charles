                    I’m originally from Nashville TN, and I moved to Chicago for a more fast-paced life. 
                    I enjoy tech, listening to and making music, and playing video games in my free time. 
                    I have a background in art and design, and I later got into audio engineering based on the love I have for music and technology. 
                    The design market was oversaturated when I graduated from college, and a few of my colleagues have since transitioned to coding. 
                    I love problem-solving, so I decided to check it out! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Web development is fascinating to me because so much of the world runs on the internet and code, but the average person doesn’t know anything about how it works. 
                    I would like to make a difference with code by introducing it to marginalized groups of kids. 
                    I lead a program that did the same thing with music recording, and it was great to see the impact it had on their lives and moods.
                    Coding has endless possibilities for their generation, and it’s important that they are given the opportunity to see how it can be used to build and create. 
                    I also like to play chess in my free time, and the more I get stuck as a developer the more interesting it becomes. Developing is like learning all the lines in chess 
                    and determining the best move to make, and I just want to get better at it every day.
